## How do I ensure my code is functional and secure?
I write clean, testable code and validate it with unit, integration, and user tests. To secure my code, I follow best practices like input validation, secure authentication, and regular vulnerability checks.

## How do I interpret user needs and apply them?
I gather user feedback through interviews, surveys, or user stories, then prioritize and implement features based on user impact. Continuous testing and feedback loops guide improvements.

## How do I approach software design?
I start by defining goals and breaking down requirements. I use diagrams or models to plan the system and focus on creating scalable, maintainable, and efficient solutions.
